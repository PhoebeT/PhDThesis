abstract = {General equations of motion are introduced for the evaluation of spin dynamics in magnetic materials. The theory uses the adiabatic separation of diagonal and off-diagonal components of the spin density matrix. This adiabatic approach considers the orientation of the local magnetic moments to be slowly varying relative to their magnitudes. The angles of the magnetization density are introduced as collective variables in density functional theory. The equations and technique can be simultaneously combined with those of first-principles molecular dynamics for the consistent treatment of spin-lattice interactions. Stochastic and deterministic approaches for treating finite temperature effects are introduced for such dynamics. The method is implemented within the local density approximation and applied to $\gamma$-Fe, a frustrated system where we obtain additional low-energy magnetic configurations. {\textcopyright} 1996 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {The current status of half-metallicity is briefly reviewed. Three origins of half-metallicity are distinguished: In heusler C1b compounds covalent interactions similar as in III-V semiconductors are responsible. The effect is intimately related with the crystal structure, while the electron-electron interactions are weak. A second category is found in the limit. of strong magnetism. Chromium-dioxide is an archetype here. In the third category, strong electron-electron interactions can be the origin of half-metallicity like in magnetite and the double perovskites. Experiments probing half-metallicity are reviewed with a distinction between the behaviour of genuine bulk, surfaces and interfaces. The effects of temperature and disorder on half-metallicity are discussed. In general increased temperature will reduce spin-polarisation as magnons are excited. Calculations show that suitably chosen impurities counteract this effect, and may actually improve the spin-polarization at finite temperature. Finally, spin injection from nano-scale structured half-metallic contacts is discussed.},

abstract = {The quest for ultrafast magnetic processes has triggered a new field of research—femtomagnetism: using femtosecond laser pulses to demagnetize ferromagnetic metallic thin films. Despite being the subject of intense research for over a decade, the underlying mechanisms that govern the demagnetization remain unclear. Here, we investigate how an ultrashort laser pulse couples to the spin of electrons in ferromagnetic metals. It is shown that a single 50-fs laser pulse couples efficiently to a ferromagnetic film during its own propagation. This result indicates that the material polarization induced by the photon field interacts coherently with the spins. The corresponding mechanism has its origin in relativistic quantum electrodynamics, beyond the spin–orbit interaction involving the ionic potential. In addition, this coherent interaction is clearly distinguished from the incoherent ultrafast demagnetization associated with the thermalization of the spins. We forecast that the corresponding coherent self-induced processes are the dawn of a new era for future research in magnetism.},

abstract = {For an isolated quantum particle, such as an electron, the orbital (L) and spin (S) magnetic moments can change provided that the total angular momentum of the particle is conserved. In condensed matter, an efficient transfer between L and S can occur owing to the spin-orbit interaction, which originates in the relativistic motion of electrons. Disentangling the absolute contributions of the orbital and spin angular momenta is challenging, however, as any transfer between the two occurs on femtosecond timescales. Here we investigate such phenomena by using ultrashort optical laser pulses to change the magnetization of a ferromagnetic film and then probe its dynamics with circularly polarized femtosecond X-ray pulses. Our measurements enable us to disentangle the spin and orbital components of the magnetic moment, revealing different dynamics for L and S. We highlight the important role played by the spin-orbit interaction in the ultrafast laser-induced demagnetization of ferromagnetic films, and show also that the magneto-crystalline anisotropy energy is an important quantity to consider in such processes. Our study provides insights into the dynamics in magnetic systems as well as perspectives for the ultrafast control of information in magnetic recording media.},

abstract = {Electron-electron interactions are the fastest processes in materials, occurring on femtosecond to attosecond timescales, depending on the electronic band structure of the material and the excitation energy. Such interactions can play a dominant role in light-induced processes such as nano-enhanced plasmonics and catalysis, light harvesting, or phase transitions. However, to date it has not been possible to experimentally distinguish fundamental electron interactions such as scattering and screening. Here, we use sequences of attosecond pulses to directly measure electron-electron interactions in different bands of different materials with both simple and complex Fermi surfaces. By extracting the time delays associated with photoemission we show that the lifetime of photoelectrons from thedband of Cu are longer by ∼100 as compared with those from the same band of Ni. We attribute this to the enhanced electron-electron scattering in the unfilleddband of Ni. Using theoretical modeling, we can extract the contributions of electron-electron scattering and screening in different bands of different materials with both simple and complex Fermi surfaces. Our results also show that screening influences high-energy photoelectrons (≈20 eV) significantly less than low-energy photoelectrons. As a result, high-energy photoelectrons can serve as a direct probe of spin-dependent electron-electron scattering by neglecting screening. This can then be applied to quantifying the contribution of electron interactions and screening to low-energy excitations near the Fermi level. The information derived here provides valuable and unique information for a host of quantum materials.},

abstract = {Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the interrelationship between ethnicity and obesity on obstetric outcomes. Study design: This was a retrospective study examining the interaction between ethnicity and obesity for obstetric outcomes. Statistical methods included univariate and multivariate regression models. Results: In this study population of 22,658 women, 2150 (9.4{\%}) were obese (body mass index [BMI] {\textgreater}29). Obesity increased the rate of cesarean delivery, gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, and macrosomia in each ethnic group. When compared with obese white women, higher rates of cesarean delivery were noted in obese African American (odds ratio [OR] 1.50, P {\textless} .05) and Asian (OR 1.73, P {\textless} .05) women. Gestational diabetes was increased twofold in obese Latina (OR 1.94, P {\textless} .05) and Asian (OR 2.20, P {\textless} .05) women, while preeclampsia was increased only in obese Latina (1.93, P {\textless} .05) women. Conclusion: Obesity increases the risk of cesarean delivery, gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, and macrosomia, but this effect varies among different ethnicities. The biometrics of different ethnicities and associated obstetric outcomes needs further exploration. ?? 2005 Mosby, Inc. All rights reserved.},

This is in contrast to its original version and many other traditional wave-function-based all-electron band structure methods dealing with periodically ordered solids. Direct access to the GF results in several appealing features. In addition, a wide applicability of the method is achieved by employing multiple scattering theory. The basic ideas behind the resulting KKR-GF method are outlined and the different techniques to deal with the underlying multiple scattering problem are reviewed. Furthermore, various applications of the KKR-GF method are reviewed in some detail to demonstrate the remarkable flexibility of the approach. Special attention is devoted to the numerous developments of the KKR-GF method, that have been contributed in recent years by a number of work groups, in particular in the following fields: embedding schemes for atoms, clusters and surfaces, magnetic response functions and anisotropy, electronic and spin-dependent transport, dynamical mean field theory, various kinds of spectroscopies, as well as first-principles determination of model parameters.},

The calculated spectrum exhibits features that are directly related to electronic structure parameters including the 3p core spin-orbit splitting, and the unfilled d-band spin polarization. Temperature variations in the magneto-optical structure can be used to determine separately the exchange-splitting variation and spin-wave excitation contributions to the decrease in the magnetization.

We optically excite a Au/Ni layered structure in which the 30 nm Au capping layer absorbs the incident laser pump pulse and subsequently use the X-ray magnetic circular dichroism technique to probe the femtosecond demagnetization of the adjacent 15 nm Ni layer. A demagnetization effect corresponding to the scenario in which the laser directly excites the Ni film is observed, but with a slight temporal delay. We explain this unexpected observation by means of the demagnetizing effect of a superdiffusive current of non-equilibrium, non-spin-polarized electrons generated in the Au layer.},

abstract = {The laser-induced demagnetization of a ferromagnet is caused by the temperature of the electron gas as well as the lattice temperature. For long excitation pulses, the two reservoirs are in thermal equilibrium. In contrast to a picosecond laser pulse, a femtosecond pulse causes a non-equilibrium between the electron gas and the lattice. By pump pulse length dependent optical measurements, we find that the magnetodynamics in Ni caused by a picosecond laser pulse can be reconstructed from the response to a femtosecond pulse. The mechanism responsible for demagnetization on the picosecond time scale is therefore contained in the femtosecond demagnetization experiment.},

abstract = {Ultrafast laser techniques have revealed extraordinary spin dynamics in magnetic materials that equilibrium descriptions of magnetism cannot explain. Particularly important for future applications is understanding non-equilibrium spin dynamics following laser excitation on the nanoscale, yet the limited spatial resolution of optical laser techniques has impeded such nanoscale studies. Here we present ultrafast diffraction experiments with an X-ray laser that probes the nanoscale spin dynamics following optical laser excitation in the ferrimagnetic alloy GdFeCo, which exhibits macroscopic all-optical switching. Our study reveals that GdFeCo displays nanoscale chemical and magnetic inhomogeneities that affect the spin dynamics. In particular, we observe Gd spin reversal in Gd-rich nanoregions within the first picosecond driven by the non-local transfer of angular momentum from larger adjacent Fe-rich nanoregions. These results suggest that a magnetic material's microstructure can be engineered to control transient laser-excited spins, potentially allowing faster ({\~{}} 1 ps) spin reversal than in present technologies.},

Furthermore, a significant reduction of both isotropic and anisotropic contributions of extrinsic damping of the FCCS alloys was found in the FCCS films with x=0.5-0.75, which is of particular importance for applications.

The functional F[n(r)] is then discussed for two situations: (1) n(r)=n0+{\~{n}}(r), {\~{n}}n0≪1, and (2) n(r)=ϕ(rr0) with ϕ arbitrary and r0→∞. In both cases F can be expressed entirely in terms of the correlation energy and linear and higher order electronic polarizabilities of a uniform electron gas. This approach also sheds some light on generalized Thomas-Fermi methods and their limitations. Some new extensions of these methods are presented.},

abstract = {Despite intensive research, the underlying mechanisms for ultrafast demagnetization after laser irradiation in transition metals are still not understood. We discuss the possible processes which have been suggested in order to explain the ultrafast demagnetization within several hundreds of femtoseconds and argue that the spin angular momentum has to go to the lattice in the end. Based on this argument, we consider spin-flip electron-phonon scatterings. The demagnetization time tau(M) and the demagnetization rate dM/dt due to spin-flip electron-phonon scattering is calculated for fcc Ni and bcc Fe. Thereby, the electronic states and phononic states are calculated ab initio. We find that the demagnetization rates for fcc Ni and bcc Fe are too small to explain experimental demagnetization rates, which is in agreement with earlier publications. In addition, the demagnetization rates for band structures with reduced exchange splitting are calculated, however, also these demagnetization rates are too small. Finally, the phase space for scattering processes which is related to the maximum possible demagnetization is estimated for band structures with ground-state exchange splitting and with reduced exchange splitting. The maximum possible demagnetization is too small for bcc Fe and fcc Co but not necessarily for fcc Ni. We suggest to include magnons and to consider independent combinations of spin-flip electron-phonon and spin-flip electron-magnon scattering processes as a possible explanation for the ultrafast demagnetization.},

It is found that the ferro-to paramagnetic phase transition can occur in less than one picosecond, in agreement with published experimental data. Calculating the spin temperature via the internal energy of the spin system we find that the system does not necessarily fully demagnetize even for spin temperatures above the Curie temperature. Our findings suggest that the spin system is far from thermal equilibrium so that the concept of a spin temperature has to be questioned on the time scale of picoseconds. Most importantly, the time for recovery of the magnetization can vary by orders of magnitude depending on the magnetic state after heating, a prediction which is verified by supporting pump-probe experiments.

We find a small ({\textless}0.03µB) Ti moment oriented antiparallel and a large ({\textgreater}3µB) Mn moment oriented parallel to the Co moment of approximately 1µB per atom in the investigated compounds. Orbital magnetic moments are increased for quaternary compounds compared to the corresponding ternary compounds with x=0 or x=1. The unoccupied spin-resolved partial DOS at the Co atom was extracted from the XMCD data. In the case of Co2TiSi, Co2TiGe, and Co2TiSn, the Co minority DOS reveals a maximum at 0.5 eV above EF and very low values at EF in agreement with the expectation for half-metallic ferromagnetism. In contrast, Co2TiSb shows a large minority DOS at the Fermi energy like a normal metal. A substitution of Ti by Mn in Co2TiSi shifts the minority DOS maximum from 0.5 to 0.9 eV with respect to the Fermi energy. For the series Co2MnGa1−xGex we observe a gradual shift of the minority DOS maximum from 0.7 eV for x=1 to 1.0 eV for x=0, indicating half-metallic ferromagnetism for the whole series. Our results, revealing the distribution of magnetic moments and the relative position of the Fermi energy as a function of the number of valence electrons, confirm the predicted possibility of tailoring the minority band gap using substitutional quaternary Heusler compounds.

Independent of the spin-scattering mechanism, an appealingly simple equation relating the two key parameters via the Curie temperature T(C) is derived, tau(M) approximately c(0)h/k(B)T(C)sigma, with h and k(B) the Planck and Boltzmann constants, respectively, and the prefactor c(0) approximately 1/4).

It was reported that demagnetization in gadolinium proceeds within 100 ps, but three orders of magnitude faster in ferromagnetic transition metals such as nickel. Here we show that a model based on electron-phonon-mediated spin-flip scattering explains both timescales on equal footing. Our interpretation is supported by ab initio estimates of the spin-flip scattering probability, and experimental fluence dependencies are shown to agree perfectly with predictions. A phase diagram is constructed in which two classes of laser-induced magnetization dynamics can be distinguished, where the ratio of the Curie temperature to the atomic magnetic moment turns out to have a crucial role. We conclude that the ultrafast magnetization dynamics can be well described disregarding highly excited electronic states, merely considering the thermalized electron system.},

We calculate both the microscopic Andreev reflection amplitude for a single reflection event and an effective Andreev reflection amplitude describing the effect of multiple Andreev reflections in a ballistic thin film geometry. It is shown that the angle and energy dependence of the Andreev reflection amplitude strongly depends on the orientation of the gradient of the magnetization with respect to the interface.

Our measurements demonstrate conclusively that transverse magneto-optical Kerr measurements at the M2,3 edges sensitively probe the magnetic state, with almost negligible contributions from the transient variation of the refractive index by the nonequilibrium hot-electron distribution. In addition, we compare pump-probe demagnetization dynamics measured by both high harmonics and conventional visible-wavelength magneto-optics and find that the measured demagnetization times are in agreement.},

Direct access to the dynamic electron density as electrons are shared or transferred between atoms in a chemical bond would greatly improve our understanding of molecular bonding and structure. Using reaction microscope techniques, we show that we can capture how the entire valence shell electron density in a molecule rearranges, from molecular-like to atomic-like, as a bond breaks. An intense ultrashort laser pulse is used to ionize a bromine molecule at different times during dissociation, and we measure the total ionization signal and the angular distribution of the ionization yield. Using this technique, we can observe density changes over a surprisingly long time and distance, allowing us to see that the electrons do not localize onto the individual Br atoms until the fragments are far apart (∼5.5 Å), in a region where the potential energy curves for the dissociation are nearly degenerate. Our observations agree well with calculations of the strong-field ionization rates of the bromine molecule.},

abstract = {The dependence of the strength of the electron-phonon coupling and the electron heat capacity on the electron temperature is investigated for eight representative metals, Al, Cu, Ag, Au, Ni, Pt, W, and Ti, for the conditions of strong electron-phonon nonequilibrium. These conditions are characteristic of metal targets subjected to energetic ion bombardment or short-pulse laser irradiation. Computational analysis based on first-principles electronic structure calculations of the electron density of states predicts large deviations (up to an order of magnitude) from the commonly used approximations of linear temperature dependence of the electron heat capacity and a constant electron-phonon coupling. These thermophysical properties are found to be very sensitive to details of the electronic structure of the material. The strength of the electron-phonon coupling can either increase (Al, Au, Ag, Cu, and W), decrease (Ni and Pt), or exhibit nonmonotonic changes (Ti) with increasing electron temperature. The electron heat capacity can exhibit either positive (Au, Ag, Cu, and W) or negative (Ni and Pt) deviations from the linear temperature dependence. The large variations of the thermophysical properties, revealed in this work for the range of electron temperatures typically realized in femtosecond laser material processing applications, have important implications for quantitative computational analysis of ultrafast processes associated with laser interaction with metals.},

abstract = {Since the discovery in 1996 that the magnetization of a nickel thin film is reduced within a few picoseconds after femtosecond-laser excitation(1), ultrafast demagnetization has attracted a thriving interest. This attraction is driven by the twofold challenge of understanding magnetization dynamics in a strongly out-of-equilibrium regime and controlling the magnetic properties of materials on the subpicosecond timescale, with potential applications in spintronics. In the past decade significant progress has been made in understanding the microscopic processes that govern ultrafast demagnetization(2-7). The discussion has been particularly focused on the role of angular-momentum conservation during the demagnetization process(8-10). Here, using the time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect, we demonstrate that interlayer transfer of spin angular momentum in specially engineered Co/Pt multilayers speeds up the demagnetization process, bypassing the mechanism responsible for the conservation of total angular momentum taking place in a single ferromagnetic layer. This new channel for spin-angular-momentum dissipation leads to a reduction of the demagnetization time of up to 25{\%}, accompanied by an increase of the total demagnetization by almost the same amount.},

abstract = {Interest in femtosecond demagnetization dynamics was sparked by Bigot's experiment in 1996, which unveiled the elementary mechanisms that relate the electrons' temperature to their spin order. Simultaneously, the application of fast demagnetization experiments has been demonstrated to provide key insight into technologically important systems such as high-spin-polarization metals, and consequently there is broad interest in further understanding the physics of these phenomena. To gain new and relevant insights, we performed ultrafast optical pump-probe experiments to characterize the demagnetization processes of highly spin-polarized magnetic thin films on a femtosecond time scale. Full spin polarization is obtained in half-metallic ferro- or ferrimagnets, where only one spin channel is populated at the Fermi level, whereas the other one exhibits a gap. In these materials, the spin-scattering processes is controlled via the electronic structure, and thus their ultrafast demagnetization is solely related to the spin polarization via a Fermi golden-rule model. Accordingly, a long demagnetization time correlates with a high spin polarization due to the suppression of the spin-flip scattering at around the Fermi level. Here we show that isoelectronic Heusler compounds (Co2MnSi, Co2MnGe, and Co2FeAl) exhibit a degree of spin polarization between 59{\%} and 86{\%}. We explain this behavior by considering the robustness of the gap against structural disorder. Moreover, we observe that CoFe-based pseudogap materials, such as partially ordered Co-Fe-Ge and Co-Fe-B alloys, can reach similar values of the spin polarization. By using the unique features of these metals we vary the number of possible spin-flip channels, which allows us to pinpoint and control the half-metals' electronic structure and its influence on the elementary mechanisms of ultrafast demagnetization.},

We show that for times shorter than the characteristic timescale for exchange coupling, the magnetization of Fe quenches more strongly than that of Ni. Then as the Fe moments start to randomize, the strong ferromagnetic exchange interaction induces further demagnetization in Ni, with a characteristic delay determined by the strength of the exchange interaction.

Two new sets of measurements of C,(Ni), 333-15OOK, have been combined with literature data to produce an evaluated data set with uncertainty 5 ?2{\%}. These smoothed data have been analyzed into vibrational harmonic, electronic, magnetic and dilatational contributions with the aid of auxiliary measurements of expansion coefficient, compressibility, vibrational and electronic densities of states, elastic constants, and magnetic exchange integral and susceptibility obtained from the literature. The vibrational harmonic term is interpreted in terms of a 0,-v{\&}T curve in accord with predictions of the density-of-states distribution. The electronic contribution is smaller than predicted by free-electron theory due to a large electron-phonon effect. The electronic term for paramagnetic nickel is in good agreement with that predicted from band calculations. The magnetic contribution yields a magnetic entropy in accord with theoretical predictions, and a magnetic internal energy and critical-point behavior in agreement with the isotropic Heisenberg model. The experimental heat capacity can be accounted for without reference to vibrational anharmonic and vacancy contributions. in accord with recent calculations.},

Considering three mutually coupled reservoirs, (i) spin-up electrons, (ii) spin-down electrons and (iii) phonons, we trace non-equilibrium electron distributions during and after laser excitation. We identified the driving force for ultrafast magnetization dynamics as the equilibration of temperatures and chemical potentials between electronic subsystems. This principle can be used to easily predict the maximum quenching of magnetization upon ultrashort laser irradiation in any material, as we show for the case of 3d-ferromagnetic nickel.},

Here, we used femtosecond optical excitation of half-metals to distinguish between half-metallic and metallic properties. Because the direct energy transfer by Elliot-Yafet scattering is blocked in a half-metal, the demagnetization time is a measure for the degree of half-metallicity. We propose that this characteristic enables us vice versa to establish a novel and fast characterization tool for this highly important material class used in spin-electronic devices. The technique has been applied to a variety of materials where the spin polarization at the Fermi level ranges from 45 to 98{\%}: Ni, Co(2)MnSi, Fe(3)O(4), La(0.66)Sr(0.33)MnO(3) and CrO(2).},

abstract = {We have studied the effect of depositing submonolayer quantities of Cu onto the CO exposed Co/Cu(110) system at room temperature using the magneto-optic Kerr effect. Cu overlayers are found to completely reverse the in-plane 90 easy axis switch caused by the CO adsorption, for all Co thicknesses studied up to 40 ML. The Cu reverses the sign of the effective in-plane uniaxial anisotropy KUeff thereby switching the easy axis from the 1-10 to the 001 direction. Two modes of switching are observed depending on the magnitude of the cubic magnetocrystalline anisotropy constant K1 which is in turn dependent on the thickness of the Co films. For sufficiently thick Co films (dCo {\textgreater} 15 ML), the easy axis is found to shift gradually from the 1-10 to the 001 direction due to the competition between the cubic and effective uniaxial anisotropy contributions. Therefore, we are able to controllably engineer the direction of the easy axis in this system as a function of Cu overlayer thickness. For thin Co films (dCu {\textless} 15 ML) K1 tends to zero as revealed by BLS measurements of Hillebrands et al. and the easy axis switch is abrupt. We have engineered an experimental realization of an isotropic two-dimensional XY magnet by depositing submonolayer coverages of Cu onto a CO exposed 5 ML Co/Cu(110) film with a zero cubic anisotropy component K1 at room temperature. For a Cu coverage of 1.02 ML, the uniaxial anisotropy component vanishes also, and we observe a corresponding loss of ferromagnetic order at remanence. Further Cu deposition restores the uniaxial anisotropy and the magnetic order. Therefore we have directly observed the stabilization of ferromagnetic order by magnetic anisotropy in an ultrathin magnetic film, as theoretically predicted.},

abstract = {Uncovering the physical mechanisms that govern ultrafast charge and spin dynamics is crucial for understanding correlated matter as well as the fundamental limits of ultrafast spin-based electronics. Spin dynamics in magnetic materials can be driven by ultrashort light pulses, resulting in a transient drop in magnetization within a few hundred femtoseconds. However, a full understanding of femtosecond spin dynamics remains elusive. Here we spatially separate the spin dynamics using Ni/Ru/Fe magnetic trilayers, where the Ni and Fe layers can be ferro- or antiferromagnetically coupled. By exciting the layers with a laser pulse and probing the magnetization response simultaneously but separately in Ni and Fe, we surprisingly find that optically induced demagnetization of the Ni layer transiently enhances the magnetization of the Fe layer when the two layer magnetizations are initially aligned parallel. Our observations are explained by a laser-generated superdiffusive spin current between the layers.},

abstract = {With the model proposed in an earlier paper, the temperature variation of the ferromagnetism of nickel is discussed. By application of Fermi statistics to the electrons in the d bands, the free energy is computed as a function of temperature and magnetic moment. At each temperature, the value of magnetic moment for which the free energy is a minimum is the value which will actually be found, and this decreases with increasing temperature, going to zero at the Curie point, in satisfactory agreement with experiment. The value of the free energy itself at the minimum, as a function of temperature, is compared with experimental values derived from the observed electronic specific heat of nickel, and the agreement is again satisfactory. To get agreement of both quantities with experiment, it is necessary to use a smaller exchange integral than was suggested in the earlier paper, but plausible reasons are suggested for thinking that this should be done anyway. It is found that even at the absolute zero not quite all of the spins are parallel to each other, the minimum in the free energy curve coming at a little less than the maximum possible magnetic moment. It is suggested that this small effect becomes much more pronounced as iron is approached in the series of ferromagnetic elements, explaining the fact that alloys of iron and cobalt show the highest saturation moments of any ferromagnetic substances, the moment then decreasing in iron and even more in alloys of iron with lighter elements.},

The coherent potential is necessarily a complex, energy-dependent quantity. We evaluate the model for the simple case of a one-dimensional alloy of $\delta$-function potentials. In order to provide a basis for comparison, as well as to see if a simpler scheme will suffice, we also calculate the spectrum of the same alloy using the average t-matrix approximation introduced by Beeby. On the basis of these results, we conclude that the average t-matrix approximation is not adequate for the description of an actual transition-metal alloy, while the coherent-potential picture will provide a more reasonable facsimile of the density of states in such an alloy.},

abstract = {The rapidly increasing information density required of modern magnetic data storage devices raises the question of the fundamental limits in bit size and writing speed. At present, the magnetization reversal of a bit can occur as quickly as 200 ps (ref. 1). A fundamental limit has been explored by using intense magnetic-field pulses of 2 ps duration leading to a non-deterministic magnetization reversal. For this process, dissipation of spin angular momentum to other degrees of freedom on an ultrafast timescale is crucial. An even faster regime down to 100 fs or below might be reached by non-thermal control of magnetization with femtosecond laser radiation. Here, we show that an efficient novel channel for angular momentum dissipation to the lattice can be opened by femtosecond laser excitation of a ferromagnet. For the first time, the quenching of spin angular momentum and its transfer to the lattice with a time constant of 120+/-70 fs is determined unambiguously with X-ray magnetic circular dichroism. We report the first femtosecond time-resolved X-ray absorption spectroscopy data over an entire absorption edge, which are consistent with an unexpected increase in valence-electron localization during the first 120+/-50 fs, possibly providing the driving force behind femtosecond spin-lattice relaxation.},

abstract = {We investigate the ultrafast demagnetization for two Heusler alloys (Co₂Mn(1-x)FexSi) with a different lineup of the minority band gap and the Fermi level. Even though electronic spin-flip transitions are partially blocked by the band gap in one compound, the respective magnetization dynamics, as measured by the time-resolved Kerr effect, are remarkably similar. Based on a dynamical model that includes momentum and spin-dependent carrier scattering, we show that the magnetization dynamics are dominated by hole spin-flip processes, which are not influenced by the gap.},

Here, we report the application of attosecond pulse trains to directly and unambiguously measure the difference in lifetimes between photoelectrons born into free-electron-like states and those excited into unoccupied excited states in the band structure of nickel (111). A significant increase in lifetime of 212 ± 30 as occurs when the final state coincides with a short-lived excited state. Moreover, a strong dependence of this lifetime on emission angle is directly related to the final-state band dispersion as a function of electron transverse momentum. This finding emphasizes the importance of the material band structure on photoemission lifetimes and corresponding electron escape depths.},

Recently, two different possible mechanisms have been proposed to explain ultrafast laser induced magnetization dynamics: spin currents and spin-flip scattering. In this work, we use multilayers of Fe and Ni with different metals and insulators as the spacer material to conclusively show that spin currents can have a significant contribution to optically induced magnetization dynamics, in addition to spin-flip scattering processes. Moreover, we can control the competition between these two processes, and in some cases completely suppress interlayer spin currents as a sample undergoes rapid demagnetization. Finally, by reversing the order of the Fe/Ni layers, we experimentally show that spin currents are directional in our samples, predominantly flowing from the top to the bottom layer.},

A Pad{\'{e}} approximant technique is used to accurately interpolate the recent Monte Carlo results (para and ferro) of Ceperley and Alder into the important range of densities for atoms, molecules, and metals. These results can be combined with the RPA spin-dependence so as to produce a correlation energy for a spin-polarized homogeneous electron gas with an estimated maximum error of 1 mRy and thus should reliably determine the magnitude of non-local corrections to the local spin...},

However, the field still faces major challenges. To become fully competitive, novel schemes for energy-efficient control of spin-wave propagation in two dimensions have to be realized on much smaller length scales than used before. In this Letter, we address these challenges with the experimental realization of a novel approach to guide spin waves in reconfigurable, nano-sized magnonic waveguides. For this purpose, we make use of two inherent characteristics of magnetism: the non-volatility of magnetic remanence states and the nanometre dimensions of domain walls formed within these magnetic configurations. We present the experimental observation and micromagnetic simulations of spin-wave propagation inside nano-sized domain walls and realize a first step towards a reconfigurable domain-wall-based magnonic nanocircuitry.},

In half-metals, long demagnetization times are expected due to the band gap for one spin direction. We have investigated the theoretically half-metallic Heusler alloy Co 2Cr 0.6Fe 0.4Al (CCFA), using the time-resolved magnetooptical Kerr effect. A demagnetization time in the range of typical transition metal ferromagnets with lower spin polarization has been found, while magnetization recovery proceeds on a slower time scale. The results are discussed in the context of recent models and experimental results. We propose that for Heusler alloys the initial stage of recovery could be a better measure for the spin polarization than the demagnetization time. A simple estimate leads to a bulk spin polarization value of 0.86 for CCFA. {\textcopyright} 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH {\&} Co. KGaA, Weinheim.},

abstract = {The magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) is a powerful tool for studying changes in the magnetization of ferromagnetic materials. It works by measuring changes in the polarization of reflected light. However, because the conventional theoretical basis for interpreting a MOKE signal assumes measurement with continuous-wave light, its use for understanding high-speed magnetization dynamics of a material probed with femtosecond optical pulses has been controversial. Here we establish a new paradigm for interpreting time-resolved MOKE measurements, through a first-principles investigation of ferromagnetic nickel. We show that the time-resolved optical and magnetic responses energetically follow their respective optical and magneto-optical susceptibilities. As a result, the one-to-one correspondence between them sensitively depends on the incident photon energy. In nickel, for photon energies below 2 eV the magnetic response is faithfully reflected in the optical response, but above 2 eV they decouple. By constructing a phase-sensitive polarization versus magnetization plot, we find that for short pulses the magnetic signals are delayed by 10 fs with respect to the optical signals. For longer pulses, the delay shortens and the behaviour approaches the continuous-wave response. This finally resolves the long-standing dispute over the interpretation in the time-resolved MOKE measurements and lays a solid foundation for understanding femtomagnetism.},
