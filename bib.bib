abstract = {General equations of motion are introduced for the evaluation of spin dynamics in magnetic materials. The theory uses the adiabatic separation of diagonal and off-diagonal components of the spin density matrix. This adiabatic approach considers the orientation of the local magnetic moments to be slowly varying relative to their magnitudes. The angles of the magnetization density are introduced as collective variables in density functional theory. The equations and technique can be simultaneously combined with those of first-principles molecular dynamics for the consistent treatment of spin-lattice interactions. Stochastic and deterministic approaches for treating finite temperature effects are introduced for such dynamics. The method is implemented within the local density approximation and applied to $\gamma$-Fe, a frustrated system where we obtain additional low-energy magnetic configurations. {\textcopyright} 1996 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {The current status of half-metallicity is briefly reviewed. Three origins of half-metallicity are distinguished: In heusler C1b compounds covalent interactions similar as in III-V semiconductors are responsible. The effect is intimately related with the crystal structure, while the electron-electron interactions are weak. A second category is found in the limit. of strong magnetism. Chromium-dioxide is an archetype here. In the third category, strong electron-electron interactions can be the origin of half-metallicity like in magnetite and the double perovskites. Experiments probing half-metallicity are reviewed with a distinction between the behaviour of genuine bulk, surfaces and interfaces. The effects of temperature and disorder on half-metallicity are discussed. In general increased temperature will reduce spin-polarisation as magnons are excited. Calculations show that suitably chosen impurities counteract this effect, and may actually improve the spin-polarization at finite temperature. Finally, spin injection from nano-scale structured half-metallic contacts is discussed.},

abstract = {Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the interrelationship between ethnicity and obesity on obstetric outcomes. Study design: This was a retrospective study examining the interaction between ethnicity and obesity for obstetric outcomes. Statistical methods included univariate and multivariate regression models. Results: In this study population of 22,658 women, 2150 (9.4{\%}) were obese (body mass index [BMI] {\textgreater}29). Obesity increased the rate of cesarean delivery, gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, and macrosomia in each ethnic group. When compared with obese white women, higher rates of cesarean delivery were noted in obese African American (odds ratio [OR] 1.50, P {\textless} .05) and Asian (OR 1.73, P {\textless} .05) women. Gestational diabetes was increased twofold in obese Latina (OR 1.94, P {\textless} .05) and Asian (OR 2.20, P {\textless} .05) women, while preeclampsia was increased only in obese Latina (1.93, P {\textless} .05) women. Conclusion: Obesity increases the risk of cesarean delivery, gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, and macrosomia, but this effect varies among different ethnicities. The biometrics of different ethnicities and associated obstetric outcomes needs further exploration. ?? 2005 Mosby, Inc. All rights reserved.},

Notably, the intrinsic damping constants for samples with high Co concentration are among the lowest reported for Heusler alloys and even comparable to magnetic insulator yttrium iron garnet. Furthermore, a significant reduction of both isotropic and anisotropic contributions of extrinsic damping of the FCCS alloys was found in the FCCS films with x=0.5-0.75, which is of particular importance for applications. These results demonstrate a practical recipe to tailor functional magnetization for Heusler alloy-based spintronics at room temperature},

It is proved that there exists a universal functional of the density, F[n(r)], independent of v(r), such that the expression E≡∫v(r)n(r)dr+F[n(r)] has as its minimum value the correct ground-state energy associated with v(r). The functional F[n(r)] is then discussed for two situations: (1) n(r)=n0+{\~{n}}(r), {\~{n}}n0≪1, and (2) n(r)=ϕ(rr0) with ϕ arbitrary and r0→∞. In both cases F can be expressed entirely in terms of the correlation energy and linear and higher order electronic polarizabilities of a uniform electron gas. This approach also sheds some light on generalized Thomas-Fermi methods and their limitations. Some new extensions of these methods are presented.},

We find a small ({\textless}0.03µB) Ti moment oriented antiparallel and a large ({\textgreater}3µB) Mn moment oriented parallel to the Co moment of approximately 1µB per atom in the investigated compounds. Orbital magnetic moments are increased for quaternary compounds compared to the corresponding ternary compounds with x=0 or x=1. The unoccupied spin-resolved partial DOS at the Co atom was extracted from the XMCD data. In the case of Co2TiSi, Co2TiGe, and Co2TiSn, the Co minority DOS reveals a maximum at 0.5 eV above EF and very low values at EF in agreement with the expectation for half-metallic ferromagnetism. In contrast, Co2TiSb shows a large minority DOS at the Fermi energy like a normal metal. A substitution of Ti by Mn in Co2TiSi shifts the minority DOS maximum from 0.5 to 0.9 eV with respect to the Fermi energy. For the series Co2MnGa1−xGex we observe a gradual shift of the minority DOS maximum from 0.7 eV for x=1 to 1.0 eV for x=0, indicating half-metallic ferromagnetism for the whole series. Our results, revealing the distribution of magnetic moments and the relative position of the Fermi energy as a function of the number of valence electrons, confirm the predicted possibility of tailoring the minority band gap using substitutional quaternary Heusler compounds.

Here we calculate the Andreev reflection amplitudes for the case that the spin flip originates from a spatially non-uniform magnetization direction in the half metal. We calculate both the microscopic Andreev reflection amplitude for a single reflection event and an effective Andreev reflection amplitude describing the effect of multiple Andreev reflections in a ballistic thin film geometry. It is shown that the angle and energy dependence of the Andreev reflection amplitude strongly depends on the orientation of the gradient of the magnetization with respect to the interface. Establishing a connection between the scattering approach employed here and earlier work that employs the quasiclassical formalism, we connect the symmetry properties of the Andreev reflection amplitudes to the symmetry properties of the anomalous Green function in the half metal.},

Here we explore the optical manipulation of the magnetization in engineered magnetic materials. We demonstrate that all-optical helicity-dependent switching (AO-HDS) can be observed not only in selected rare earth-transition metal (RE-TM) alloy films but also in a much broader variety of materials, including RE-TM alloys, multilayers and heterostructures. We further show that RE-free Co-Ir-based synthetic ferrimagnetic heterostructures designed to mimic the magnetic properties of RE-TM alloys also exhibit AO-HDS. These results challenge present theories of AO-HDS and provide a pathway to engineering materials for future applications based on all-optical control of magnetic order.},

abstract = {Interest in femtosecond demagnetization dynamics was sparked by Bigot's experiment in 1996, which unveiled the elementary mechanisms that relate the electrons' temperature to their spin order. Simultaneously, the application of fast demagnetization experiments has been demonstrated to provide key insight into technologically important systems such as high-spin-polarization metals, and consequently there is broad interest in further understanding the physics of these phenomena. To gain new and relevant insights, we performed ultrafast optical pump-probe experiments to characterize the demagnetization processes of highly spin-polarized magnetic thin films on a femtosecond time scale. Full spin polarization is obtained in half-metallic ferro- or ferrimagnets, where only one spin channel is populated at the Fermi level, whereas the other one exhibits a gap. In these materials, the spin-scattering processes is controlled via the electronic structure, and thus their ultrafast demagnetization is solely related to the spin polarization via a Fermi golden-rule model. Accordingly, a long demagnetization time correlates with a high spin polarization due to the suppression of the spin-flip scattering at around the Fermi level. Here we show that isoelectronic Heusler compounds (Co2MnSi, Co2MnGe, and Co2FeAl) exhibit a degree of spin polarization between 59{\%} and 86{\%}. We explain this behavior by considering the robustness of the gap against structural disorder. Moreover, we observe that CoFe-based pseudogap materials, such as partially ordered Co-Fe-Ge and Co-Fe-B alloys, can reach similar values of the spin polarization. By using the unique features of these metals we vary the number of possible spin-flip channels, which allows us to pinpoint and control the half-metals' electronic structure and its influence on the elementary mechanisms of ultrafast demagnetization.},

abstract = {The underlying physics of all ferromagnetic behavior is the cooperative interaction between individual atomic magnetic moments that results in a macroscopic magnetization. In this work, we use extreme ultraviolet pulses from high-harmonic generation as an element-specific probe of ultrafast, optically driven, demagnetization in a ferromagnetic Fe-Ni alloy (permalloy). We show that for times shorter than the characteristic timescale for exchange coupling, the magnetization of Fe quenches more strongly than that of Ni. Then as the Fe moments start to randomize, the strong ferromagnetic exchange interaction induces further demagnetization in Ni, with a characteristic delay determined by the strength of the exchange interaction. We can further enhance this delay by lowering the exchange energy by diluting the permalloy with Cu. This measurement probes how the fundamental quantum mechanical exchange coupling between Fe and Ni in magnetic materials influences magnetic switching dynamics in ferromagnetic materials relevant to next-generation data storage technologies.},

We distinguish relaxation of relativistic and exchange origin and show that when the former dominates, nonequivalent sublattices have distinct dynamics despite their strong exchange coupling. Even more interesting, in the exchange dominated regime sublattices can show highly counterintuitive transitions between parallel and antiparallel alignment. This allows us to explain recent experiments with antiferromagnetically coupled sublattices, and predict that such transitions are possible with ferromagnetic coupling as well. In addition, we predict that exchange relaxation enhances the demagnetization speed of both sublattices only when they are antiferromagnetically coupled.},

abstract = {Knowledge of the spin polarization is of fundamental importance for the use of a material in spintronics applications. Here, we used femtosecond optical excitation of half-metals to distinguish between half-metallic and metallic properties. Because the direct energy transfer by Elliot-Yafet scattering is blocked in a half-metal, the demagnetization time is a measure for the degree of half-metallicity. We propose that this characteristic enables us vice versa to establish a novel and fast characterization tool for this highly important material class used in spin-electronic devices. The technique has been applied to a variety of materials where the spin polarization at the Fermi level ranges from 45 to 98{\%}: Ni, Co(2)MnSi, Fe(3)O(4), La(0.66)Sr(0.33)MnO(3) and CrO(2).},

The coherent potential is necessarily a complex, energy-dependent quantity. We evaluate the model for the simple case of a one-dimensional alloy of $\delta$-function potentials. In order to provide a basis for comparison, as well as to see if a simpler scheme will suffice, we also calculate the spectrum of the same alloy using the average t-matrix approximation introduced by Beeby. On the basis of these results, we conclude that the average t-matrix approximation is not adequate for the description of an actual transition-metal alloy, while the coherent-potential picture will provide a more reasonable facsimile of the density of states in such an alloy.},

In this Letter, we address these challenges with the experimental realization of a novel approach to guide spin waves in reconfigurable, nano-sized magnonic waveguides. For this purpose, we make use of two inherent characteristics of magnetism: the non-volatility of magnetic remanence states and the nanometre dimensions of domain walls formed within these magnetic configurations.

In half-metals, long demagnetization times are expected due to the band gap for one spin direction. We have investigated the theoretically half-metallic Heusler alloy Co 2Cr 0.6Fe 0.4Al (CCFA), using the time-resolved magnetooptical Kerr effect. A demagnetization time in the range of typical transition metal ferromagnets with lower spin polarization has been found, while magnetization recovery proceeds on a slower time scale. The results are discussed in the context of recent models and experimental results.
